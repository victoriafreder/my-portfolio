Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage

In this activity you will work to create a portfolio webpage that will use HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. Then deploy your webpage to Netlify.

You can use CSS or Bootstrap or both to design and personalize your portfolio. Use outside resources and documentation to solve any challenges you encounter. Create a Github repository and clone it to your local device, add, commit and push often. Use comments to describe the reasoning behind your code.
